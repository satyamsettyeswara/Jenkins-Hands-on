Managing Credentials in Jenkins
Goal: Learn how to store and use credentials securely in Jenkins.

1. Add Credentials in Jenkins
Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials > Select (global) > Add Credentials.

Choose "Username with password" or "Secret text", depending on what you need.

Example:

Username: my-user

Password: mypassword123

ID: MY_CRED (This is how we reference it in pipelines).

Click OK to save.

2. Use Credentials in a Pipeline
Modify your pipeline to retrieve the credentials securely:

-----------------------------------------------------
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Use Credentials') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'MY_CRED', usernameVariable: 'USER', passwordVariable: 'PASS')]) {
                    sh 'echo "Using username: $USER"'
                    // Don't echo passwords! Just using for demonstration
                    sh 'echo "Password is $PASS"'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
-----------------------------------------------------
3. Run the Job & Verify
Important: Jenkins will mask the password in the logs.

Check the console outputâ€”only the username should be visible, but the password should be hidden.
