Helm Chart Versioning & CI/CD with Jenkins
Goal:
✅ Implement versioning for Helm charts
✅ Automate Helm chart publishing using Jenkins

🔹 Step 1️⃣: Modify Your Helm Chart for Versioning
1️⃣ Update the Chart.yaml file inside your Helm chart directory (myapp/Chart.yaml):

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v2
name: myapp
description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes
version: 0.2.0
appVersion: "2.0.0"
🔹 The version field is for Helm chart versioning
🔹 The appVersion is for application versioning

🔹 Step 2️⃣: Modify Jenkins Pipeline for Helm Versioning
1️⃣ Go to Jenkins → Open Your Helm Pipeline Job
2️⃣ Modify the pipeline to push the chart to a Helm repository:

groovy
Copy
Edit
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        CHART_VERSION = "0.2.0"
        HELM_REPO_URL = "https://your-helm-repo.com"
    }
    stages {
        stage('Package Helm Chart') {
            steps {
                sh 'helm package myapp --version $CHART_VERSION'
            }
        }
        stage('Push to Helm Repo') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                curl -u user:password -T myapp-$CHART_VERSION.tgz $HELM_REPO_URL
                '''
            }
        }
    }
}
🔹 This pipeline packages the Helm chart
🔹 It then uploads it to a Helm chart repository

🔹 Step 3️⃣: Run the Pipeline
🔹 Trigger a build in Jenkins
✅ Jenkins packages & uploads the Helm chart
✅ You should see the new version in the Helm repository

🎯 What You Achieved
✔ Automated Helm chart versioning
✔ Uploaded Helm charts to a repository
