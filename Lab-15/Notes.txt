 Running Jenkins in Docker
📝 Goal
We will:
✅ Install Docker (if not installed)
✅ Pull the Jenkins Docker image
✅ Run Jenkins in a Docker container
✅ Access Jenkins in a browser

Step 1️⃣: Install Docker
First, let’s check if Docker is installed.

🔹 Open your terminal and run:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker --version
If Docker is installed, you'll see an output like this:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Docker version 24.0.6, build ed223bc
If not installed, install it using:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
After installation, start and enable Docker so it runs on boot:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
Now, check again:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker --version
Step 2️⃣: Allow Jenkins to Use Docker
By default, only the root user can run Docker commands.
To allow your user to run Docker, execute:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
Then, log out and log back in for changes to take effect.

🔹 Check if the change worked by running:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker ps
If it shows an empty list, you're good! 🎯
If you get a permission error, restart your system.

Step 3️⃣: Pull the Jenkins Docker Image
Now, download the official Jenkins image:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker pull jenkins/jenkins:lts
This might take a few minutes depending on your internet speed.

🔹 Verify the image is downloaded by running:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker images
You should see something like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
REPOSITORY     TAG     IMAGE ID       CREATED      SIZE
jenkins/jenkins  lts   a5b5aa8c1234   3 days ago  600MB
Step 4️⃣: Run Jenkins in a Container
Now, let’s start Jenkins inside Docker:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker run -d --name jenkins-docker \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
  -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts
🔹 Explanation:

-d → Runs in the background

--name jenkins-docker → Names the container

-p 8080:8080 → Maps Jenkins web interface to port 8080

-p 50000:50000 → Needed for agent communication

-v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home → Saves Jenkins data

🔹 Check if Jenkins is running:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker ps
Expected output:

bash
Copy
Edit
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             STATUS          PORTS
abc12345       jenkins/jenkins   Up 10 minutes  0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp
Step 5️⃣: Access Jenkins
Now, open your browser and go to:
👉 http://localhost:8080

🔹 Find the Jenkins admin password by running:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker exec jenkins-docker cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Copy this password and paste it in the Jenkins setup wizard.

Complete the setup by:
✔ Installing Suggested Plugins
✔ Creating an Admin User
✔ Setting up Jenkins

🔍 Expected Output
You should see the Jenkins dashboard at http://localhost:8080. 🎉
