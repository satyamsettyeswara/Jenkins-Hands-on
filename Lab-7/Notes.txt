Jenkins Job Logs and Build History Management
Goal: Learn how to manage Jenkins logs, configure build retention, and clean up old builds.

1. Configure Build Retention Policy
Open an existing job (e.g., TriggerJob).

Click Configure > Scroll to Discard old builds.

Check the box and enter:

Max # of builds to keep: 5

Max # of days to keep builds: 7

Save the job.

2. View and Manage Build Logs
Run the job multiple times.

Go to Build History and verify old builds are being deleted after the limit is reached.

Click on any build > Console Output to check logs.

3. Clean Up Workspace Manually
Open the job > Click Workspace.

Manually delete unnecessary files.

Alternatively, add this post-build step in the pipeline to clean up after each build:

--------------------------------------------------------
post {
    always {
        cleanWs()
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------------
4. Configure Jenkins System Log
Go to Manage Jenkins > System Log.

View logs and understand where Jenkins stores them ($JENKINS_HOME/logs).
